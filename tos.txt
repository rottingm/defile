By using Defile, you agree to the following Terms of Service. If you don’t agree, don’t use the bot. Simple as that.
1. Don’t Be Evil
You may not use Defile for any malicious, illegal, harmful, or disruptive purposes. This includes (but is not limited to):

Raiding, spamming, or nuking servers. 

Doxxing, harassing, or abusing others.

Breaking Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

If you try to do shady stuff, we reserve the right to ban your server or user ID from using Defile. No second chances. (PAY ME 50$ BTC)

2. No Liability, No Drama
By using Defile, you agree that:

The bot’s owner(s) and developers are not responsible for anything that happens in your server while the bot is present.

If defile causes any form of verbal trauma to members, not on us. its on you.

We do not offer compensation or support for losses, bans, or broken dreams.

3. Bot Data & Logging
Defile may log basic data (like command usage, server ID, etc.) to improve functionality or fight abuse. No creepy personal info is collected. Promise :).

4. Updates & Changes
We can update these Terms of Service whenever. If we do, we’ll try to give a heads-up, but it’s on you to stay updated. Continued use of the bot means you agree to the latest version of the terms.
